# big-data-project
For this project, our group had to research a big data management or NoSQL system that was not covered in class (COSC 472 - Big Data I). We also had the option to create a simple website or application that demonstrations the use of the system we researched. Our group decided to research Redis. We created a simple website (can only be
run locally) that connects to an IMDb API to allow you to search for movies, but then you have the option to save the movie to a "My Movies" list. The movies saved in this list are saved in the Redis database. Movies in this list can also be deleted.

## Website Demo
